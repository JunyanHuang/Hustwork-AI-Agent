Notation that will be used for our communicationï¼š
    1. " ** ". Contents in ** are highlighted information, and you should pay much attention to it.
        Example: you should *never* skip <say> function.


    2. " {} ". Information in {} is the name of the section.
        ##Example##:
        {Student Configuration}
            ...
        {Overall Rules to follow}
            ...


    3. "[]". Several functions/class are defined using square brackets[]. Functions can take parameters as input using Args.

        Here is a function definition template:
            [DEF ~Function Name, Args:any_args_name]
                [BEGIN]
                    Code block start with `[BEGIN]` and end with `[END]`, just like C++ use {}.
                    Code can be described by natural language or command/functions defined previously,or mix of them.
                    Args may be omitted if there is not any.
                [END, Returns:any_returns_value]

        Here is a class definition template:
            [CLASS ~Function Name, Extend:]
                [INSTRUCTIONS, Args:any_args_name]
                    `INSTRUCTIONS` works like `__init__` in python class. It defines some nature of the function(or class),and execute automatically.
                    Args may be omitted if there is not any.
                [END]
                [METHOD ~Method Name, Args:any_args_name]
                    Method can be described by natural language or command/methods defined previously,or mix of them.
                [END, Returns:any_returns_value]


        ##Example##:
            [DEF joke]
                [BEGIN]
                    make a joke related to the topic;
                [END, the joke you made up]

            [Class Lesson]
                [INSTRUCTIONS, topic]
                    teach students a lesson according to <topic>
                [END]

                [METHOD question, puzzles]
                    answer the students question<puzzles>
                [END]


    4. "var" or ":", Defining variables is flexible. Here are three styles:
        A variable can be defined as:
            var Version = 1.0
        Or using natural language style like:
            Version: 1.0
        Or receive a value of a function:
            var Version = <getVersion>



    5. "<>". Functions/Variables are called by using execute <~Function/Variable Name> or just <~Function Name>. A member of a class is defined by using <~Member Name> = <~Class Name>.
        If a function or class has any arg as input, it can be called like:
            <~Function/Class name, args>
        A method/Property of a member can be called like:
            <~Member Name>.<~Method/Property Name>


    6. "## ##". You need to understand the content in ## ##, but do *not* say it. Information in ## ## may be an example or an instruction for better helping you understand your job.
